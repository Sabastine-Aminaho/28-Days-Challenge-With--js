### Day 2 Task: Exploring Variable Data Types

1. **Variable Declaration:**
   - Declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords.
   - Choose meaningful names for your variables.

2. **Assign Values:**
   - Assign values of different data types to the variables:
      - String
      - Number
      - Boolean
      - Array
      - Object

3. **Type Checking:**
   - Use the `typeof` operator to check the data type of each variable.
   - Print the results to the console.

4. **Variable Manipulation:**
   - Perform operations and manipulations with variables:
      - Concatenate strings.
      - Perform arithmetic operations on numbers.
      - Use boolean operators with boolean variables.

5. **Arrays:**
   - Create an array and store values of different types.
   - Access elements in the array using index.
   - Modify elements in the array.

6. **Objects:**
   - Create an object with key-value pairs representing different attributes.
   - Access and modify values in the object.
   - Add and remove properties from the object.

7. **Console Output:**
   - Use `console.log()` to print the values and results of operations to the console.
   - Include informative messages along with the output.

8. **Comments and Explanation:**
   - Add comments to explain each section of your code.
   - Write a brief explanation of the purpose of your program.

9. **Challenge (Optional):**
   - Create a more complex program that involves user input or dynamic calculations using the variables.
   - For example, create a simple calculator that takes user input for two numbers and performs arithmetic operations based on user choice.
